###TME Education 
(Yogo Jankowska) <br>
TME Education was founded by Transfer Multisort Elektronik, one of the leading
global distributors of electronic components based in Poland. The company
recognizes the impact the technological advancements have on the labour market
and how they shape the situation. At the same time, this very tendency puts
many young people at risk of being left behind as the access to proper technical
education is often limited in their regions. Over a quarter of a century of
experience in international markets enabled TME to launch a unique initiative
that joins technology and intercultural knowledge exchange. TME Education is
the answer to the threat of growing inequality. The programme aims to engage
the youth in changing their reality by becoming lifelong learners and using
technology and innovative approach combined to create better perspectives not
only for one person but also for the whole community.

It all began in 2016 when the project started its cooperation with KNUST in
Ghana, one of the biggest technical school of tertiary level in Wester Africa,
which is attended by over 40 thousand students each year. The partnership
resulted in establishing of a large electronics lab which was fully furnished by
TME Education. Since then, the project has supported schools in Uganda,
Tanzania, Zambia, Cameroon and soon in Kenya and Ethiopia. The assistance
offered by the programme is not the equipment only. The substantial pillar of
TME Education’s philosophy is forming close and long-lasting relationships with
schools and other educational institutions. Apart from furnishing labs with
specialized equipment, the project also offers further assistance, workshops for
students and training for teachers. The goal is not to provide tools but to co-
create quality education and bring up a new generation of the electronics
specialist. The project aims to engage young technology enthusiasts in changing
the reality around them by developing their innate capacities, talents and realizing
their ideas. For this reason, it was necessary to learn about them and
their communities first. That’s why another substantial aspect of the program’s
activity was establishing the role of an ambassador.
